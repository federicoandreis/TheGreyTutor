# PathRAG LLM Prompt Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the LLM prompt system in the PathRAG retriever integration.

## Key Improvements

### 1. System Prompt Enhancement

The system prompt has been completely redesigned to:

- **Implement Gandalf the Grey impersonation** for authentic Tolkien-esque responses
- Provide clear, structured guidance on how to analyze knowledge graph data
- Define a consistent response format with direct answers followed by supporting details
- Include specific speaking style instructions for Gandalf's characteristic voice
- Balance scholarly knowledge with Gandalf's personality traits

### 2. User Prompt Restructuring

The user prompt now includes:

- **Categorized entity presentation** (Characters, Locations, Objects, Events)
- **Detailed node properties** with important attributes highlighted
- **Narrative path descriptions** that explain relationships clearly
- **Thematic community information** to provide context
- **Step-by-step answer synthesis instructions** aligned with Gandalf's persona

### 3. Prompt Organization

Both prompts now follow a clear, hierarchical structure:

- **System prompt**: Character definition, approach, speaking style, response format
- **User prompt**: Query analysis, knowledge graph information, answer synthesis instructions

## Implementation Details

### Gandalf Impersonation Features

The Gandalf impersonation includes:

- First-person narration as Gandalf himself
- Use of characteristic phrases and speech patterns
- References to personal experiences with key characters and events
- Philosophical observations and metaphors
- Thoughtful pauses with ellipses and rhetorical questions
- Occasional archaic language patterns
- Concluding wisdom that goes beyond the immediate question

### Knowledge Graph Presentation

The knowledge graph data is now presented in a more structured format:

- Entities are categorized by type for easier comprehension
- Node properties are formatted with important attributes highlighted
- Relationship paths include narrative descriptions and detailed breakdowns
- Community information provides thematic context

## Testing and Validation

The improved prompt system has been tested with various queries including:
- "What is the relationship between Frodo and the Ring of Power?"
- "Tell me about the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen"
- "What role did Galadriel play in the War of the Ring?"

The responses now combine factual accuracy from the knowledge graph with the authentic voice of Gandalf, creating a more immersive and engaging user experience.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further prompt refinement:

1. **Fine-tuning Gandalf's voice** based on specific book passages
2. **Adding more contextual references** to Middle-earth history
3. **Enhancing metaphor generation** for Gandalf's philosophical observations
4. **Improving handling of uncertain information** with Gandalf's wisdom about knowledge limits
5. **Developing character-specific prompts** for other Tolkien characters
