Glamdring

Alas, dear student, your answer is not correct. Frodo's sword is named Sting, a blade that glows blue in the presence of Orcs. Glamdring, on the other hand, is the sword of Gandalf himself, forged in the First Age. It is a fine weapon, but it does not belong to Frodo. Remember, each sword in Middle-earth has its own story and significance, much like the characters who wield them.
