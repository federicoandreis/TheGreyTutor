Ah, dear student, while J.K. Rowling is indeed a talented author, she is not the creator of The Lord of the Rings. That honor belongs to J.R.R. Tolkien, a master of myth and language who crafted the rich tapestry of Middle-earth. His works, including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, have enchanted readers for generations, weaving tales of bravery, friendship, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.
