Glamdring, on the other hand, is the sword of Gandalf himself, forged in the ancient days and known as the 'Foe-Hammer.' It is important to remember the distinction between these notable weapons in our tales. Sting is a symbol of Frodo's courage and his journey, while Glamdring represents the power and wisdom of the Istari.",
