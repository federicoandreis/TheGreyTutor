Glamdring

Alas, dear student, your answer is not correct. Frodo's sword is named Sting, a blade that glows blue in the presence of Orcs. Glamdring, on the other hand, is the sword of Gandalf himself, forged in the ancient days and known as the 'Foe-Hammer.' It is important to remember the distinction between these notable weapons in our tales. Sting is a symbol of Frodo's courage and his journey, while Glamdring represents the power and wisdom of the Istari.
