What is the name of Frodo's sword?

[2025-06-04 11:07:11] USER:
Orcrist

Ah, dear student, while Orcrist is indeed a notable sword, it belongs to Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the Company of Dwarves in 'The Hobbit.' The correct name of Frodo's sword is Sting, a blade that glows blue in the presence of Orcs and was gifted to him by Bilbo. It is a fine weapon for a hobbit, indeed! Understanding the lineage of these weapons is crucial in our tales.
