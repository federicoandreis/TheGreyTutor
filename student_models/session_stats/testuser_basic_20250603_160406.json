        "explanation": "Alas, dear student, your answer is not correct. The creature that Gandalf faced on the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm was a Balrog, a fearsome demon of shadow and flame. This encounter is a pivotal moment in 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' where Gandalf stands against the Balrog to protect his companions. The Balrog is a servant of Morgoth, and its presence in Moria signifies great peril. Remember, knowledge of these dark creatures enriches our understanding of the trials faced by the Fellowship.",

        "explanation": "Ah, dear student, while Sauron played a significant role in the tale of the Rings, it was actually Celebrimbor, the Elven smith of Eregion, who forged the Three Elven Rings of Power. Sauron, under the guise of Annatar, assisted him in the creation of the other Rings, but the Three were made without his direct influence, as Celebrimbor sought to preserve the beauty and purity of the Elves.
