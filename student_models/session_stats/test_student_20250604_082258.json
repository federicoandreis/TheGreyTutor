The correct answer includes Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, and Gandalf himself. The Fellowship was formed to aid Frodo in his quest to destroy the One Ring, and each member played a vital role in this perilous journey. Gondor is indeed a significant realm in Middle-earth, but it is not a member of the Fellowship.",

      "feedback": {
        "explanation": "While your answer captures the essence of the Elves' resilience, it overlooks the complexities of their fate in the face of Sauron's corruption. The children of the Elves, or 'elf-children', are indeed often shielded by their kin, but they are not entirely untouched by the darkness that Sauron spreads. The influence of evil can reach even the purest hearts, and the Elves must remain vigilant against its seductive call. In Tolkien's lore, the Elves are deeply affected by the sorrow and strife that arise from the shadow of Mordor, and their children must learn to navigate this perilous world. Thus, while they seek refuge in the light, they are not immune to the trials that come with it.",
