        "explanation": "The answer provided by the student is incorrect. The noble guest known for his unyielding spirit and kindness who was ever at the side of the One Ring's bearer is Frodo Baggins himself. Frodo, a hobbit of the Shire, bore the One Ring on its perilous journey to Mount Doom. While Legolas is indeed a noble character and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, he did not bear the Ring nor was he the primary guide for Frodo. Instead, it was Gandalf, Aragorn, and Samwise Gamgee who played pivotal roles in guiding Frodo through his trials. Understanding the roles of these characters is essential to grasping the depth of Tolkien's narrative.",
        "strengths": [
          "The student correctly identifies a character from the Fellowship of the Ring.",
          "Legolas is a noble character, which aligns with the question's description."

        "weaknesses": [
          "The answer does not address the specific character who bore the One Ring.",
          "It lacks an understanding of the relationships and roles within the Fellowship."
        ],
        "suggestions": [
          "Review the roles of the characters in 'The Lord of the Rings', particularly focusing on Frodo's journey.",
          "Consider the relationships and dynamics within the Fellowship to better understand who guided whom."

      "feedback": {
        "explanation": "The student's answer is incorrect. The correct title of Valandil, the son of Isildur, is 'King of Arnor.' Valandil was the first king of Arnor after the death of his father Isildur, who was a significant figure in the history of Middle-earth, particularly in the struggle against Sauron. Understanding the lineage and titles of the D\u00fanedain is crucial, as it reflects the legacy of the kingdoms of Men and their connection to the greater narrative of the War of the Ring.",
        "strengths": [],
        "weaknesses": [
          "The answer provided is factually incorrect.",
          "The student confused Valandil with a character from Rohan, which indicates a misunderstanding of the lore."
        ],
        "suggestions": [
          "Review the lineage of Isildur and the history of Arnor to better understand the titles and roles of its kings.",
          "Familiarize yourself with the different realms of Men in Middle-earth, such as Gondor and Rohan, to avoid mixing characters and their respective titles."
