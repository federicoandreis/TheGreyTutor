"""
CommunityAnalyzer: Uses aliases and summaries to detect bridge entities and propose soft, provenance-rich links between communities.
- Never merges communities, only links them via bridge entities or summary-based associations.
- All proposals are annotated with evidence (aliases, summary elements, etc.).
- Fully respects the original ingestion logic and schema.
