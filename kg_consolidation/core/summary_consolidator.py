"""
SummaryConsolidator: Additive, provenance-rich community summary consolidation for the Tolkien Knowledge Graph.
- Always appends and annotates new information, never overwrites or deletes original content.
- Tracks provenance for each fact/sentence (which summary or node it came from).
- Uses LLM/rule-based aggregation if summaries disagree, but always preserves originals for traceability.
- All actions are reversible and fully provenance-aware.
