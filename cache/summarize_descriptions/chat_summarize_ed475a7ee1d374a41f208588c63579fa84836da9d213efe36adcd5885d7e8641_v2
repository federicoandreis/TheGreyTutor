However, they are currently not on visiting terms with Bilbo. This suggests a strained relationship between the Sackville-Bagginses and Bilbo, possibly due to the inheritance dispute over Bag End. Despite being related, there seems to be some tension or disagreement that has led to a lack of communication or interaction between them. The Sackville-Baggins family's expectation of inheriting Bag End indicates a sense of entitlement or assumption of ownership within the family.
