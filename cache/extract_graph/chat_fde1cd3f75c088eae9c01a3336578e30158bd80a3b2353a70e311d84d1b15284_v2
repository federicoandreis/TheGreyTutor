Small  hobbit- children  ran  after  the  cart  all  through  Hobbiton  and  right  up the  hill.  It  had  a  cargo  of  fireworks,  as  they  rightly  guessed. At  Bilbo’s  front  door  the  old  man  began  to  unload:  there were  great  bundles  of  fireworks  of  all  sorts  and  shapes,  each labelled  with  a  large  red  G  ^  and  the  elf-rune,  JJ>!\nThat  was  Gandalf’s  mark,  of  course,  and  the  old  man was  Gandalf  the  Wizard,  whose  fame  in  the  Shire  was  due mainly  to  his  skill  with  fires,  smokes,  and  lights.  His  real business  was  far  more  difficult  and  dangerous,  but  the Shire -folk  knew  nothing  about  it.  To  them  he  was  just  one of  the  ‘attractions’  at  the  Party.  Hence  the  excitement  of the  hobbit-children.  ‘G  for  Grand!’  they  shouted,  and  the old  man  smiled.  They  knew  him  by  sight,  though  he  only appeared  in  Hobbiton  occasionally  and  never  stopped  long; but  neither  they  nor  any  but  the  oldest  of  their  elders  had seen  one  of  his  firework  displays  -  they  now  belonged  to  a legendary  past.\nWhen  the  old  man,  helped  by  Bilbo  and  some  dwarves, had  finished  unloading,  Bilbo  gave  a  few  pennies  away;  but\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY  33\nnot  a  single  squib  or  cracker  was  forthcoming,  to  the  dis¬ appointment  of  the  onlookers.\n‘Run  away  now!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You  will  get  plenty  when the  time  comes.’  Then  he  disappeared  inside  with  Bilbo,  and the  door  was  shut.  The  young  hobbits  stared  at  the  door  in vain  for  a  while,  and  then  made  off,  feeling  that  the  day  of the  party  would  never  come.\nInside  Bag  End,  Bilbo  and  Gandalf  were  sitting  at  the  open window  of  a  small  room  looking  out  west  on  to  the  garden. The  late  afternoon  was  bright  and  peaceful.  The  flowers glowed  red  and  golden:  snap-dragons  and  sunflowers,  and nasturtians  trailing  all  over  the  turf  walls  and  peeping  in  at the  round  windows.\n‘How  bright  your  garden  looks!’  said  Gandalf.\n‘Yes,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘I  am  very  fond  indeed  of  it,  and  of  all the  dear  old  Shire;  but  I  think  I  need  a  holiday.’\n‘You  mean  to  go  on  with  your  plan  then?’\n‘I  do.  I  made  up  my  mind  months  ago,  and  I  haven’t changed  it.  ’\n‘Very  well.  It  is  no  good  saying  any  more.  Stick  to  your plan  -  your  whole  plan,  mind  -  and  I  hope  it  will  turn  out for  the  best,  for  you,  and  for  all  of  us.’\n‘I  hope  so.  Anyway  I  mean  to  enjoy  myself  on  Thursday, and  have  my  little  joke.’\n‘Who  will  laugh,  I  wonder?’  said  Gandalf,  shaking  his  head.\n‘We  shall  see,’  said  Bilbo.\nThe  next  day  more  carts  rolled  up  the  Hill,  and  still  more carts.  There  might  have  been  some  grumbling  about  ‘dealing locally’,  but  that  very  week  orders  began  to  pour  out  of  Bag End  for  every  kind  of  provision,  commodity,  or  luxury  that could  be  obtained  in  Hobbiton  or  Bywater  or  anywhere  in the  neighbourhood.  People  became  enthusiastic;  and  they began  to  tick  off  the  days  on  the  calendar;  and  they  watched eagerly  for  the  postman,  hoping  for  invitations.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fde1cd3f75c088eae9c01a3336578e30158bd80a3b2353a70e311d84d1b15284_v2"}
