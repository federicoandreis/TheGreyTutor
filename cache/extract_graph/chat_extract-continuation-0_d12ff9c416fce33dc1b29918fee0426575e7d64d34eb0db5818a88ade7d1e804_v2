A regular  warren,  by  all  accounts.  Old  Master  Gorbadoc  never had  fewer  than  a  couple  of  hundred  relations  in  the  place. Mr.  Bilbo  never  did  a  kinder  deed  than  when  he  brought  the lad  back  to  live  among  decent  folk.\n‘But  I  reckon  it  was  a  nasty  knock  for  those  Sackville- Bagginses.

Mr.  Bilbo  is  free  with his  money,  and  there  seems  no  lack  of  it;  but  I  know  of  no tunnel-making.

But  my  lad  Sam will  know  more  about  that.  He’s  in  and  out  of  Bag  End. Crazy  about  stories  of  the  old  days,  he  is,  and  he  listens  to all  Mr.  Bilbo’s  tales.
