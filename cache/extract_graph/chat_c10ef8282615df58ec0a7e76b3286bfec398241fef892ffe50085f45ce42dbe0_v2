As  mayor  almost  his  only  duty  was to  preside  at  banquets,  given  on  the  Shire-holidays,  which occurred  at  frequent  intervals.  But  the  offices  of  Postmaster and  First  Shirriff  were  attached  to  the  mayoralty,  so  that  he managed  both  the  Messenger  Service  and  the  Watch.  These were  the  only  Shire-services,  and  the  Messengers  were  the most  numerous,  and  much  the  busier  of  the  two.  By  no means  all  Hobbits  were  lettered,  but  those  who  were  wrote constantly  to  all  their  friends  (and  a  selection  of  their relations)  who  lived  further  off  than  an  afternoon’s  walk.\nThe  Shirriffs  was  the  name  that  the  Hobbits  gave  to  their police,  or  the  nearest  equivalent  that  they  possessed.  They had,  of  course,  no  uniforms  (such  things  being  quite  un¬ known),  only  a  feather  in  their  caps;  and  they  were  in  practice rather  haywards  than  policemen,  more  concerned  with  the strayings  of  beasts  than  of  people.  There  were  in  all  the  Shire only  twelve  of  them,  three  in  each  Farthing,  for  Inside  Work. A  rather  larger  body,  varying  at  need,  was  employed  to  ‘beat the  bounds’,  and  to  see  that  Outsiders  of  any  land,  great  or small,  did  not  make  themselves  a  nuisance.\nAt  the  time  when  this  story  begins  the  Bounders,  as  they were  called,  had  been  greatly  increased.  There  were  many reports  and  complaints  of  strange  persons  and  creatures prowling  about  the  borders,  or  over  them:  the  first  sign  that all  was  not  quite  as  it  should  be,  and  always  had  been  except\n14\nPROLOGUE\nin  tales  and  legends  of  long  ago.  Few  heeded  the  sign,  and not  even  Bilbo  yet  had  any  notion  of  what  it  portended.  Sixty years  had  passed  since  he  set  out  on  his  memorable  journey, and  he  was  old  even  for  Hobbits,  who  reached  a  hundred as  often  as  not;  but  much  evidently  still  remained  of  the considerable  wealth  that  he  had  brought  back.  How  much  or how  little  he  revealed  to  no  one,  not  even  to  Frodo  his  favour¬ ite  ‘nephew’.  And  he  still  kept  secret  the  ring  that  he  had found.\n4\nOf  the  Finding  of  the  Ring\nAs  is  told  in  The  Hobbit,  there  came  one  day  to  Bilbo’s  door  the great  Wizard,  Gandalf  the  Grey,  and  thirteen  dwarves  with him:  none  other,  indeed,  than  Thorin  Oakenshield,  descend¬ ant  of  kings,  and  his  twelve  companions  in  exile.  With  them he  set  out,  to  his  own  lasting  astonishment,  on  a  morning  of April,  it  being  then  the  year  1341  Shire -reckoning,  on  a  quest of  great  treasure,  the  dwarf-hoards  of  the  Kings  under  the Mountain,  beneath  Erebor  in  Dale,  far  off  in  the  East.  The quest  was  successful,  and  the  Dragon  that  guarded  the  hoard was  destroyed.  Yet,  though  before  all  was  won  the  Battle  of Five  Armies  was  fought,  and  Thorin  was  slain,  and  many deeds  of  renown  were  done,  the  matter  would  scarcely  have concerned  later  history,  or  earned  more  than  a  note  in the  long  annals  of  the  Third  Age,  but  for  an  ‘accident’  by  the way.  The  party  was  assailed  by  Ores  in  a  high  pass  of  the Misty  Mountains  as  they  went  towards  Wilderland;  and  so  it happened  that  Bilbo\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c10ef8282615df58ec0a7e76b3286bfec398241fef892ffe50085f45ce42dbe0_v2"}
