Fie  held  forth  at The  Ivy  Bush,  a  small  inn  on  the  Bywater  road;  and  he  spoke with  some  authority,  for  he  had  tended  the  garden  at  Bag End  for  forty  years,  and  had  helped  old  Holman  in  the  same job  before  that.  Now  that  he  was  himself  growing  old  and stiff  in  the  joints,  the  job  was  mainly  carried  on  by  his  young¬ est  son,  Sam  Gamgee.  Both  father  and  son  were  on  very friendly  terms  with  Bilbo  and  Frodo.  They  lived  on  the  Hill itself,  in  Number  3  Bagshot  Row  just  below  Bag  End.\n‘A  very  nice  well-spoken  gentlehobbit  is  Mr.  Bilbo,  as  I’ve always  said,’  the  Gaffer  declared.  With  perfect  truth:  for  Bilbo was  very  polite  to  him,  calling  him  ‘Master  Hamfast’,  and\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY\n29\nconsulting  him  constantly  upon  the  growing  of  vegetables  - in  the  matter  of  ‘roots’,  especially  potatoes,  the  Gaffer  was recognized  as  the  leading  authority  by  all  in  the  neighbour¬ hood  (including  himself) .\n‘But  what  about  this  Frodo  that  lives  with  him?’  asked  Old Noakes  of  Bywater.  ‘Baggins  is  his  name,  but  he’s  more  than half  a  Brandybuck,  they  say.  It  beats  me  why  any  Baggins of  Hobbiton  should  go  looking  for  a  wife  away  there  in Buckland,  where  folks  are  so  queer.’\n‘And  no  wonder  they’re  queer,’  put  in  Daddy  Twofoot (the  Gaffer’s  next-door  neighbour),  ‘if  they  live  on  the  wrong side  of  the  Brandywine  River,  and  right  agin  the  Old  Forest. That’s  a  dark  bad  place,  if  half  the  tales  be  true.’\n‘You’re  right,  Dad!’  said  the  Gaffer.  ‘Not  that  the  Brandy- bucks  of  Buckland  live  in  the  Old  Forest;  but  they’re  a  queer breed,  seemingly.  They  fool  about  with  boats  on  that  big river  -  and  that  isn’t  natural.  Small  wonder  that  trouble  came of  it,  I  say.  But  be  that  as  it  may,  Mr.  Frodo  is  as  nice  a young  hobbit  as  you  could  wish  to  meet.  Very  much  like Mr.  Bilbo,  and  in  more  than  looks.  After  all  his  father  was a  Baggins.  A  decent  respectable  hobbit  was  Mr.  Drogo Baggins;  there  was  never  much  to  tell  of  him,  till  he  was drownded.’\n‘Drownded?’  said  several  voices.  They  had  heard  this  and other  darker  rumours  before,  of  course;  but  hobbits  have  a passion  for  family  history,  and  they  were  ready  to  hear  it again.\n‘Well,  so  they  say,’  said  the  Gaffer.  ‘You  see:  Mr.  Drogo, he  married  poor  Miss  Primula  Brandybuck.  She  was  our  Mr. Bilbo’s  first  cousin  on  the  mother’s  side  (her  mother  being the  youngest  of  the  Old  Took’s  daughters);  and  Mr.  Drogo was  his  second  cousin.  So  Mr.  Frodo  is  his  first  and  second cousin,  once  removed  either  way,  as  the  saying  is,  if  you follow  me.  And  Mr.  Drogo  was  staying  at  Brandy  Hall  with his  father-in-law,  old  Master  Gorbadoc,  as  he  often  did after  his  marriage  (him  being  partial  to  his  vittles,  and  old Gorbadoc  keeping  a  mighty  generous  table) ;  and  he  went  out\n30\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING\nboating  on  the  Brandywine  River;  and  he  and  his  wife  were drownd\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7ca3ed05e4fdeb2ef4175f32054a767e313dc08d380827ccf724eda6d8d0d277_v2"}
