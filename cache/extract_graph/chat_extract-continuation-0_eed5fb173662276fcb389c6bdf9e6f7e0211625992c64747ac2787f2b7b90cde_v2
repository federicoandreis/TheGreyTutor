They  shot  well  with  the  bow,  for  they were  keen-eyed  and  sure  at  the  mark.  Not  only  with  bows  and\nPROLOGUE\narrows.  If  any  Hobbit  stooped  for  a  stone,  it  was  well  to  get quickly  under  cover,  as  all  trespassing  beasts  knew  very  well.\nAll  Hobbits  had  originally  lived  in  holes  in  the  ground,  or so  they  believed,  and  in  such  dwellings  they  still  felt  most  at home;  but  in  the  course  of  time  they  had  been  obliged  to adopt  other  forms  of  abode.  Actually  in  the  Shire  in  Bilbo’s days  it  was,  as  a  rule,  only  the  richest  and  the  poorest  Hobbits that  maintained  the  old  custom.  The  poorest  went  on  living in  burrows  of  the  most  primitive  kind,  mere  holes  indeed, with  only  one  window  or  none;  while  the  well-to-do  still constructed  more  luxurious  versions  of  the  simple  diggings of  old.  But  suitable  sites  for  these  large  and  ramifying  tunnels (or  smials  as  they  called  them)  were  not  everywhere  to  be found;  and  in  the  flats  and  the  low-lying  districts  the  Hobbits, as  they  multiplied,  began  to  build  above  ground.  Indeed,  even in  the  hilly  regions  and  the  older  villages,  such  as  Hobbiton or  Tuckborough,  or  in  the  chief  township  of  the  Shire,  Michel Delving  on  the  White  Downs,  there  were  now  many  houses of  wood,  brick,  or  stone.  These  were  specially  favoured  by millers,  smiths,  ropers,  and  Cartwrights,  and  others  of  that sort;  for  even  when  they  had  holes  to  live  in,  Hobbits  had long  been  accustomed  to  build  sheds  and  workshops.\nThe  habit  of  building  farmhouses  and  barns  was  said  to have  begun  among  the  inhabitants  of  the  Marish  down  by the  Brandywine.  The  Hobbits  of  that  quarter,  the  East¬ farthing,  were  rather  large  and  heavy-legged,  and  they  wore dwarf-boots  in  muddy  weather.  But  they  were  well  known  to be  Stoors  in  a  large  part  of  their  blood,  as  indeed  was  shown by  the  down  that  many  grew  on  their  chins.  No  Harfoot  or Fallohide  had  any  trace  of  a  beard.  Indeed,  the  folk  of  the Marish,  and  of  Buckland,  east  of  the  River,  which  they  after¬ wards  occupied,  came  for  the  most  part  later  into  the  Shire up  from  south-away;  and  they  still  had  many  peculiar  names and  strange  words  not  found  elsewhere  in  the  Shire.\nIt  is  probable  that  the  craft  of  building,  as  many  other  crafts beside,  was  derived  from  the  Dunedain.  But  the  Hobbits  may have  learned  it  direct  from  the  Elves,  the  teachers  of  Men  in\nPROLOGUE\n9\ntheir  youth.  For  the  Elves  of  the  High  Kindred  had  not  yet forsaken  Middle-earth,  and  they  dwelt  still  at  that  time  at  the Grey  Havens  away  to  the  west,  and  in  other  places  within reach  of  the  Shire.  Three  Elf- towers  of  immemorial  age  were still  to  be  seen  on  the  Tower  Hills  beyond  the  western marches.  They  shone  far  off  in  the  moonlight.  The  tallest was  furthest  away,  standing  alone  upon  a  green  mound.  The Hobbits  of  the  Westfarthing  said  that  one  could  see  the  Sea from  the  top  of  that  tower;  but  no  Hobbit  had  ever  been known  to  climb  it.  Indeed,  few  Hobbits  had  ever  seen  or sailed  upon  the  Sea,  and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOBBIT<|>PERSON<|>Hobbits are small, human-like creatures who originally lived in holes in the ground and are known for their keen eyesight and skill with bows and arrows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIRE<|>GEO<|>The Shire is the homeland of the Hobbits, where they live in various types of dwellings above and below ground)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILBO<|>PERSON<|>Bilbo is a well-known Hobbit who lived in the Shire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARISH<|>GEO<|>A region in the Shire where the inhabitants began the habit of building farmhouses and barns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDYWINE<|>GEO<|>A river near the Marish in the Shire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNEDAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dunedain are a group from whom the Hobbits may have derived the craft of building)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELVES<|>PERSON<|>Elves are immortal beings who may have taught the craft of building to the Hobbits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREY HAVENS<|>GEO<|>A location where Elves dwelt in Middle-earth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOWER HILLS<|>GEO<|>A location where Elf-towers of immemorial age were still visible)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBIT<|>SHIRE<|>Hobbits live in the Shire, their homeland<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARISH<|>BRANDYWINE<|>The Marish is located near the Brandywine river<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNEDAIN<|>HOBBIT<|>The Hobbits may have derived the craft of building from the Dunedain<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELVES<|>HOBBIT<|>Elves may have taught the craft of building to the Hobbits<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELVES<|>GREY HAVENS<|>Elves dwelt at the Grey Havens in Middle-earth<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOWER HILLS<|>ELVES<|>Elf-towers were visible on the Tower Hills where Elves dwelt<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
