But  my  lad  Sam will  know  more  about  that.  He’s  in  and  out  of  Bag  End. Crazy  about  stories  of  the  old  days,  he  is,  and  he  listens  to all  Mr.  Bilbo’s  tales.  Mr.  Bilbo  has  learned  him  his  letters  - meaning  no  harm,  mark  you,  and  I  hope  no  harm  will  come of  it.\n‘ Elves  and  Dragons!  I  says  to  him.  Cabbages  and  potatoes  are better  for  me  and  yon.  Don’t  go  getting  mixed  up  in  the  business of  your  betters,  or  you’ll  land  in  trouble  too  big  for  you,  I  says  to him.  And  I  might  say  it  to  others,’  he  added  with  a  look  at the  stranger  and  the  miller.\nBut  the  Gaffer  did  not  convince  his  audience.  The  legend of  Bilbo’s  wealth  was  now  too  firmly  fixed  in  the  minds  of the  younger  generation  of  hobbits.\n‘Ah,  but  he  has  likely  enough  been  adding  to  what  he brought  at  first,’  argued  the  miller,  voicing  common  opinion. ‘He’s  often  away  from  home.  And  look  at  the  outlandish  folk that  visit  him:  dwarves  coming  at  night,  and  that  old  wandering conjuror,  Gandalf,  and  all.  You  can  say  what  you  like,  Gaffer, but  Bag  End’s  a  queer  place,  and  its  folk  are  queerer.’\n‘And  you  can  say  what  you  like,  about  what  you  know  no more  of  than  you  do  of  boating,  Mr.  Sandyman,’  retorted the  Gaffer,  disliking  the  miller  even  more  than  usual.  ‘If  that’s being  queer,  then  we  could  do  with  a  bit  more  queerness  in these  parts.  There’s  some  not  far  away  that  wouldn’t  offer  a pint  of  beer  to  a  friend,  if  they  lived  in  a  hole  with  golden walls.  But  they  do  things  proper  at  Bag  End.  Our  Sam  says that  everyone’s  going  to  be  invited  to  the  party,  and  there’s going  to  be  presents,  mark  you,  presents  for  all  -  this  very month  as  is.’\n32\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING\nThat  very  month  was  September,  and  as  fine  as  you  could ask.  A  day  or  two  later  a  rumour  (probably  started  by  the knowledgeable  Sam)  was  spread  about  that  there  were  going to  be  fireworks  -  fireworks,  what  is  more,  such  as  had  not been  seen  in  the  Shire  for  nigh  on  a  century,  not  indeed  since the  Old  Took  died.\nDays  passed  and  The  Day  drew  nearer.  An  odd-looking waggon  laden  with  odd-looking  packages  rolled  into  Hobbi- ton  one  evening  and  toiled  up  the  Hill  to  Bag  End.  The startled  hobbits  peered  out  of  lamplit  doors  to  gape  at  it.  It was  driven  by  outlandish  folk,  singing  strange  songs:  dwarves with  long  beards  and  deep  hoods.  A  few  of  them  remained at  Bag  End.  At  the  end  of  the  second  week  in  September  a cart  came  in  through  Bywater  from  the  direction  of  Brandy¬ wine  Bridge  in  broad  daylight.  An  old  man  was  driving  it  all alone.  He  wore  a  tall  pointed  blue  hat,  a  long  grey  cloak,  and a  silver  scarf.  He  had  a  long  white  beard  and  bushy  eyebrows that  stuck  out  beyond  the  brim  of  his  hat.  Small  hobbit- children  ran  after  the  cart  all  through  Hobbiton  and  right  up the  hill.  It  had  a  cargo  of  fireworks,  as  they  rightly  guessed.
