The  party  was  assailed  by  Ores  in  a  high  pass  of  the Misty  Mountains  as  they  went  towards  Wilderland;  and  so  it happened  that  Bilbo  was  lost  for  a  while  in  the  black  ore- mines  deep  under  the  mountains,  and  there,  as  he  groped  in vain  in  the  dark,  he  put  his  hand  on  a  ring,  lying  on  the  floor of  a  tunnel.  He  put  it  in  his  pocket.  It  seemed  then  like  mere luck.\nTrying  to  find  his  way  out,  Bilbo  went  on  down  to  the roots  of  the  mountains,  until  he  could  go  no  further.  At  the\nPROLOGUE\n15\nbottom  of  the  tunnel  lay  a  cold  lake  far  from  the  light,  and on  an  island  of  rock  in  the  water  lived  Gollum.  He  was  a loathsome  little  creature:  he  paddled  a  small  boat  with  his large  flat  feet,  peering  with  pale  luminous  eyes  and  catching blind  fish  with  his  long  fingers,  and  eating  them  raw.  He  ate any  living  thing,  even  ore,  if  he  could  catch  it  and  strangle  it without  a  struggle.  He  possessed  a  secret  treasure  that  had come  to  him  long  ages  ago,  when  he  still  lived  in  the  light:  a ring  of  gold  that  made  its  wearer  invisible.  It  was  the  one thing  he  loved,  his  ‘Precious’,  and  he  talked  to  it,  even  when it  was  not  with  him.  For  he  kept  it  hidden  safe  in  a  hole  on his  island,  except  when  he  was  hunting  or  spying  on  the  ores of  the  mines.\nMaybe  he  would  have  attacked  Bilbo  at  once,  if  the  ring had  been  on  him  when  they  met;  but  it  was  not,  and  the hobbit  held  in  his  hand  an  Elvish  knife,  which  served  him  as a  sword.  So  to  gain  time  Gollum  challenged  Bilbo  to  the Riddle -game,  saying  that  if  he  asked  a  riddle  which  Bilbo could  not  guess,  then  he  would  kill  him  and  eat  him;  but  if Bilbo  defeated  him,  then  he  would  do  as  Bilbo  wished:  he would  lead  him  to  a  way  out  of  the  tunnels.\nSince  he  was  lost  in  the  dark  without  hope,  and  could neither  go  on  nor  back,  Bilbo  accepted  the  challenge;  and they  asked  one  another  many  riddles.  In  the  end  Bilbo  won the  game,  more  by  luck  (as  it  seemed)  than  by  wits;  for  he was  stumped  at  last  for  a  riddle  to  ask,  and  cried  out,  as  his hand  came  upon  the  ring  he  had  picked  up  and  forgotten: What  have  I  got  in  my  pocket?  This  Gollum  failed  to  answer, though  he  demanded  three  guesses.\nThe  Authorities,  it  is  true,  differ  whether  this  last  question was  a  mere  ‘question’  and  not  a  ‘riddle’  according  to  the  strict rules  of  the  Game;  but  all  agree  that,  after  accepting  it  and trying  to  guess  the  answer,  Gollum  was  bound  by  his promise.  And  Bilbo  pressed  him  to  keep  his  word;  for  the thought  came  to  him  that  this  slimy  creature  might  prove false,  even  though  such  promises  were  held  sacred,  and  of old  all  but  the  wickedest  things  feared  to  break  them.  But\ni6\nPROLOGUE\nafter  ages  alone  in  the  dark  Gollum’s  heart  was  black,  and treachery  was  in  it.
