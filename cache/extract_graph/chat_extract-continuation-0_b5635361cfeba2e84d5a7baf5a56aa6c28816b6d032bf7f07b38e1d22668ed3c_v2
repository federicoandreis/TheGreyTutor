Not  even the  Wizards  first  thought  of  that  before  we  did.  Though  one Wizard  that  I  knew  took  up  the  art  long  ago,  and  became  as skilful  in  it  as  in  all  other  things  that  he  put  his  mind  to.’\n12\nPROLOGUE\n3\nOf  the  Ordering  of  the  Shire\nThe  Shire  was  divided  into  four  quarters,  the  Farthings already  referred  to,  North,  South,  East,  and  West;  and  these again  each  into  a  number  of  folklands,  which  still  bore  the names  of  some  of  the  old  leading  families,  although  by  the time  of  this  history  these  names  were  no  longer  found  only in  their  proper  folklands.  Nearly  all  Tooks  still  lived  in  the Tookland,  but  that  was  not  true  of  many  other  families,  such as  the  Bagginses  or  the  Boffins.  Outside  the  Farthings  were the  East  and  West  Marches:  the  Buckland  (p.  129);  and  the Westmarch  added  to  the  Shire  in  S.R.  1452.\nThe  Shire  at  this  time  had  hardly  any  ‘government’. Families  for  the  most  part  managed  their  own  affairs.  Grow¬ ing  food  and  eating  it  occupied  most  of  their  time.  In other  matters  they  were,  as  a  rule,  generous  and  not  greedy, but  contented  and  moderate,  so  that  estates,  farms,  work¬ shops,  and  small  trades  tended  to  remain  unchanged  for generations.\nThere  remained,  of  course,  the  ancient  tradition  concern¬ ing  the  high  king  at  Fornost,  or  Norbury  as  they  called  it, away  north  of  the  Shire.  But  there  had  been  no  king  for  nearly a  thousand  years,  and  even  the  ruins  of  Kings’  Norbury  were covered  with  grass.  Yet  the  Hobbits  still  said  of  wild  folk  and wicked  things  (such  as  trolls)  that  they  had  not  heard  of  the king.  For  they  attributed  to  the  king  of  old  all  their  essential laws;  and  usually  they  kept  the  laws  of  free  will,  because  they were  The  Rules  (as  they  said),  both  ancient  and  just.\nIt  is  true  that  the  Took  family  had  long  been  pre-eminent; for  the  office  of  Thain  had  passed  to  them  (from  the  Old- bucks)  some  centuries  before,  and  the  chief  Took  had  borne that  title  ever  since.  The  Thain  was  the  master  of  the  Shire- moot,  and  captain  of  the  Shire-muster  and  the  Hobbitry-in- arms;  but  as  muster  and  moot  were  only  held  in  times  of emergency,  which  no  longer  occurred,  the  Thainship  had ceased  to  be  more  than  a  nominal  dignity.  The  Took  family\nPROLOGUE\n13\nwas  still,  indeed,  accorded  a  special  respect,  for  it  remained both  numerous  and  exceedingly  wealthy,  and  was  liable  to produce  in  every  generation  strong  characters  of  peculiar habits  and  even  adventurous  temperament.  The  latter  quali¬ ties,  however,  were  now  rather  tolerated  (in  the  rich)  than generally  approved.  The  custom  endured,  nonetheless,  of referring  to  the  head  of  the  family  as  The  Took,  and  of adding  to  his  name,  if  required,  a  number:  such  as  Isengrim the  Second,  for  instance.\nThe  only  real  official  in  the  Shire  at  this  date  was  the  Mayor of  Michel  Delving  (or  of  the  Shire),  who  was  elected  every seven  years  at  the  Free  Fair  on  the  White  Downs  at  the  Lithe, that  is  at  Midsummer.  As  mayor  almost  his  only  duty  was to  preside  at  banquets,  given  on  the  Shire-holidays,  which occurred  at  frequent  intervals.
