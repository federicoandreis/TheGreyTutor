The  riches  he  had brought  back  from  his  travels  had  now  become  a  local  legend, and  it  was  popularly  believed,  whatever  the  old  folk  might say,  that  the  Hill  at  Bag  End  was  full  of  tunnels  stuffed  with treasure.  And  if  that  was  not  enough  for  fame,  there  was  also his  prolonged  vigour  to  marvel  at.  Time  wore  on,  but  it seemed  to  have  little  effect  on  Mr.  Baggins.  At  ninety  he  was much  the  same  as  at  fifty.  At  ninety-nine  they  began  to  call him  well-preserved,  but  unchanged  would  have  been  nearer  the mark.  There  were  some  that  shook  their  heads  and  thought this  was  too  much  of  a  good  thing;  it  seemed  unfair  that anyone  should  possess  (apparently)  perpetual  youth  as  well as  (reputedly)  inexhaustible  wealth.\n‘It  will  have  to  be  paid  for,’  they  said.  ‘It  isn’t  natural,  and trouble  will  come  of  it!’\nBut  so  far  trouble  had  not  come;  and  as  Mr.  Baggins  was generous  with  his  money,  most  people  were  willing  to  for¬ give  him  his  oddities  and  his  good  fortune.  He  remained on  visiting  terms  with  his  relatives  (except,  of  course,  the Sackville-Bagginses),  and  he  had  many  devoted  admirers among  the  hobbits  of  poor  and  unimportant  families.  But  he had  no  close  friends,  until  some  of  his  younger  cousins  began to  grow  up.\n28\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING\nThe  eldest  of  these,  and  Bilbo’s  favourite,  was  young  Frodo Baggins.  When  Bilbo  was  ninety-nine  he  adopted  Frodo  as his  heir,  and  brought  him  to  live  at  Bag  End;  and  the  hopes  of the  Sackville-Bagginses  were  finally  dashed.  Bilbo  and  Frodo happened  to  have  the  same  birthday,  September  22nd.  ‘You had  better  come  and  live  here,  Frodo  my  lad,’  said  Bilbo one  day;  ‘and  then  we  can  celebrate  our  birthday-parties comfortably  together.’  At  that  time  Frodo  was  still  in  his tweens,  as  the  hobbits  called  the  irresponsible  twenties between  childhood  and  coming  of  age  at  thirty-three.\nTwelve  more  years  passed.  Each  year  the  Bagginses  had given  very  lively  combined  birthday-parties  at  Bag  End;  but now  it  was  understood  that  something  quite  exceptional was  being  planned  for  that  autumn.  Bilbo  was  going  to  be eleventy-one,  ill,  a  rather  curious  number,  and  a  very  re¬ spectable  age  for  a  hobbit  (the  Old  Took  himself  had  only reached  130);  and  Frodo  was  going  to  be  thirty-three,  33,  an important  number:  the  date  of  his  ‘coming  of  age’.\nTongues  began  to  wag  in  Hobbiton  and  Bywater;  and rumour  of  the  coming  event  travelled  all  over  the  Shire.  The history  and  character  of  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  became  once again  the  chief  topic  of  conversation;  and  the  older  folk suddenly  found  their  reminiscences  in  welcome  demand.\nNo  one  had  a  more  attentive  audience  than  old  Flam Gamgee,  commonly  known  as  the  Gaffer.  Fie  held  forth  at The  Ivy  Bush,  a  small  inn  on  the  Bywater  road;  and  he  spoke with  some  authority,  for  he  had  tended  the  garden  at  Bag End  for  forty  years,  and  had  helped  old  Holman\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOBBITON<|>GEO<|>Hobbiton is a location where there was much talk and excitement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILBO<|>PERSON<|>Bilbo is a rich and peculiar individual who has been a wonder in the Shire for sixty years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIRE<|>GEO<|>The Shire is the local area where Bilbo is a wonder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAG END<|>GEO<|>Bag End is the hill where Bilbo lives and is rumored to be full of treasure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRODO BAGGINS<|>PERSON<|>Frodo Baggins is Bilbo's favorite and adopted heir)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACKVILLE-BAGGINS<|>PERSON<|>The Sackville-Bagginses are relatives of Bilbo who are not on visiting terms with him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLAM GAMGEE<|>PERSON<|>Flam Gamgee, also known as the Gaffer, tended the garden at Bag End for forty years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IVY BUSH<|>GEO<|>The Ivy Bush is a small inn on the Bywater road)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BYWATER<|>GEO<|>Bywater is a location where tongues began to wag about Bilbo's upcoming birthday party)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILBO<|>FRODO BAGGINS<|>Bilbo adopted Frodo as his heir and brought him to live at Bag End<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILBO<|>SACKVILLE-BAGGINS<|>Bilbo remained on visiting terms with his relatives except the Sackville-Bagginses<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLAM GAMGEE<|>BAG END<|>Flam Gamgee tended the garden at Bag End for forty years<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLAM GAMGEE<|>IVY BUSH<|>Flam Gamgee held forth at The Ivy Bush inn on the Bywater road<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
