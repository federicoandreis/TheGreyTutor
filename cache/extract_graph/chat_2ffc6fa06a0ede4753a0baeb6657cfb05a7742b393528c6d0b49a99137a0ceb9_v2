The Hobbits  of  the  Westfarthing  said  that  one  could  see  the  Sea from  the  top  of  that  tower;  but  no  Hobbit  had  ever  been known  to  climb  it.  Indeed,  few  Hobbits  had  ever  seen  or sailed  upon  the  Sea,  and  fewer  still  had  ever  returned  to report  it.  Most  Hobbits  regarded  even  rivers  and  small  boats with  deep  misgivings,  and  not  many  of  them  could  swim. And  as  the  days  of  the  Shire  lengthened  they  spoke  less  and less  with  the  Elves,  and  grew  afraid  of  them,  and  distrustful of  those  that  had  dealings  with  them;  and  the  Sea  became  a word  of  fear  among  them,  and  a  token  of  death,  and  they turned  their  faces  away  from  the  hills  in  the  west.\nThe  craft  of  building  may  have  come  from  Elves  or  Men, but  the  Hobbits  used  it  in  their  own  fashion.  They  did  not go  in  for  towers.  Their  houses  were  usually  long,  low,  and comfortable.  The  oldest  kind  were,  indeed,  no  more  than built  imitations  of  smials ,  thatched  with  dry  grass  or  straw,  or roofed  with  turves,  and  having  walls  somewhat  bulged.  That stage,  however,  belonged  to  the  early  days  of  the  Shire,  and hobbit-building  had  long  since  been  altered,  improved  by devices,  learned  from  Dwarves,  or  discovered  by  themselves. A  preference  for  round  windows,  and  even  round  doors,  was the  chief  remaining  peculiarity  of  hobbit-architecture.\nThe  houses  and  the  holes  of  Shire-hobbits  were  often  large, and  inhabited  by  large  families.  (Bilbo  and  Frodo  Baggins were  as  bachelors  very  exceptional,  as  they  were  also  in  many other  ways,  such  as  their  friendship  with  the  Elves.)  Some¬ times,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Tooks  of  Great  Smials,  or  the Brandybucks  of  Brandy  Hall,  many  generations  of  relatives lived  in  (comparative)  peace  together  in  one  ancestral  and many-tunnelled  mansion.  All  Hobbits  were,  in  any  case,\nIO\nPROLOGUE\nclannish  and  reckoned  up  their  relationships  with  great  care. They  drew  long  and  elaborate  family-trees  with  innumerable branches.  In  dealing  with  Hobbits  it  is  important  to  remember who  is  related  to  whom,  and  in  what  degree.  It  would  be impossible  in  this  book  to  set  out  a  family-tree  that  included even  the  more  important  members  of  the  more  important families  at  the  time  which  these  tales  tell  of.  The  genealogical trees  at  the  end  of  the  Red  Book  of  Westmarch  are  a  small book  in  themselves,  and  all  but  Hobbits  would  find  them exceedingly  dull.  Hobbits  delighted  in  such  things,  if  they  were accurate:  they  liked  to  have  books  filled  with  things  that  they already  knew,  set  out  fair  and  square  with  no  contradictions.\n2\nConcerning  Pipe-weed\nThere  is  another  astonishing  thing  about  Hobbits  of  old  that must  be  mentioned,  an  astonishing  habit:  they  imbibed  or inhaled,  through  pipes  of  clay  or  wood,  the  smoke  of  the burning  leaves  of  a  herb,  which  they  called  pipe-weed  or  leaf, a  variety  probably  of  Nicotiana.  A  great  deal  of  mystery surrounds  the  origin  of  this  peculiar  custom,  or  ‘art’  as  the Hobbits  preferred  to  call  it.  All  that  could  be  discovered  about it  in  antiquity  was  put  together  by  Meriadoc  Brandybuck (later  Master  of  Buckland),  and  since  he  and  the  tobacco  of the  Southfarthing  play  a  part  in  the  history\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2ffc6fa06a0ede4753a0baeb6657cfb05a7742b393528c6d0b49a99137a0ceb9_v2"}
