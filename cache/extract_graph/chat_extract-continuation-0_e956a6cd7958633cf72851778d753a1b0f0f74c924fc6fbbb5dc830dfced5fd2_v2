And  in  those  days  also  they  forgot  what¬ ever  languages  they  had  used  before,  and  spoke  ever  after  the Common  Speech,  the  Westron  as  it  was  named,  that  was current  through  all  the  lands  of  the  kings  from  Arnor  to Gondor,  and  about  all  the  coasts  of  the  Sea  from  Belfalas  to Lune.  Yet  they  kept  a  few  words  of  their  own,  as  well  as  their own  names  of  months  and  days,  and  a  great  store  of  personal names  out  of  the  past.\nAbout  this  time  legend  among  the  Hobbits  first  becomes history  with  a  reckoning  of  years.  For  it  was  in  the  one  thou¬ sand  six  hundred  and  first  year  of  the  Third  Age  that  the Fallohide  brothers,  Marcho  and  Blanco,  set  out  from  Bree; and  having  obtained  permission  from  the  high  king  at Fornost,*  they  crossed  the  brown  river  Baranduin  with  a great  following  of  Hobbits.  They  passed  over  the  Bridge  of Stonebows,  that  had  been  built  in  the  days  of  the  power  of the  North  Kingdom,  and  they  took  all  the  land  beyond  to dwell  in,  between  the  river  and  the  Far  Downs.  All  that  was\n*  As  the  records  of  Gondor  relate  this  was  Argeleb  II,  the  twentieth of  the  Northern  line,  which  came  to  an  end  with  Arvedui  three  hundred years  later.\n6\nPROLOGUE\ndemanded  of  them  was  that  they  should  keep  the  Great Bridge  in  repair,  and  all  other  bridges  and  roads,  speed  the king’s  messengers,  and  acknowledge  his  lordship.\nThus  began  the  Shire-reckoning ,  for  the  year  of  the  crossing of  the  Brandywine  (as  the  Hobbits  turned  the  name)  became Year  One  of  the  Shire,  and  all  later  dates  were  reckoned  from it.*  At  once  the  western  Hobbits  fell  in  love  with  their  new land,  and  they  remained  there,  and  soon  passed  once  more out  of  the  history  of  Men  and  of  Elves.  While  there  was  still a  king  they  were  in  name  his  subjects,  but  they  were,  in  fact, ruled  by  their  own  chieftains  and  meddled  not  at  all  with events  in  the  world  outside.  To  the  last  battle  at  Fornost  with the  Witch-lord  of  Angmar  they  sent  some  bowmen  to  the  aid of  the  king,  or  so  they  maintained,  though  no  tales  of  Men record  it.  But  in  that  war  the  North  Kingdom  ended;  and then  the  Hobbits  took  the  land  for  their  own,  and  they  chose from  their  own  chiefs  a  Thain  to  hold  the  authority  of  the king  that  was  gone.  There  for  a  thousand  years  they  were little  troubled  by  wars,  and  they  prospered  and  multiplied after  the  Dark  Plague  (S.R.  37)  until  the  disaster  of  the  Long Winter  and  the  famine  that  followed  it.  Many  thousands  then perished,  but  the  Days  of  Dearth  (1158-60)  were  at  the  time of  this  tale  long  past  and  the  Hobbits  had  again  become accustomed  to  plenty.  The  land  was  rich  and  kindly,  and though  it  had  long  been  deserted  when  they  entered  it,  it  had before  been  well  tilled,  and  there  the  king  had\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BREE<|>GEO<|>Location approximately forty miles east of the Shire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHETWOOD<|>GEO<|>Forest area surrounding Bree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIRE<|>GEO<|>Region inhabited by Hobbits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNEDAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Group of humans who taught the Hobbits how to write)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Race that taught the Dunedain the art of writing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WESTRON<|>EVENT<|>Common language spoken by various kingdoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARNOR<|>GEO<|>Kingdom in the north)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GONDOR<|>GEO<|>Kingdom in the south)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELFALAS<|>GEO<|>Coastal region)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUNE<|>GEO<|>Coastal region)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALLOHIDE<|>PERSON<|>Hobbit brothers who set out from Bree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCHO<|>PERSON<|>One of the Fallohide brothers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLANCO<|>PERSON<|>One of the Fallohide brothers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORNOST<|>GEO<|>Location where the Fallohide brothers obtained permission from the high king)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARANDUIN<|>GEO<|>River crossed by the Fallohide brothers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STONEBOWS<|>GEO<|>Bridge crossed by the Fallohide brothers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>Former kingdom where the Stonebows bridge was built)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIRE-RECKONING<|>EVENT<|>System of dating used by the Hobbits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDYWINE<|>GEO<|>River crossed by the Hobbits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAIN<|>PERSON<|>Chieftain chosen by the Hobbits to hold authority)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNEDAIN<|>HOBBITS<|>Dunedain taught Hobbits how to write<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELVES<|>DUNEDAIN<|>Elves taught the Dunedain the art of writing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALLOHIDE<|>BREE<|>Fallohide brothers set out from Bree<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALLOHIDE<|>FORNOST<|>Fallohide brothers obtained permission from the high king at Fornost<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALLOHIDE<|>BARANDUIN<|>Fallohide brothers crossed the Baranduin river<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALLOHIDE<|>STONEBOWS<|>Fallohide brothers passed over the Stonebows bridge<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STONEBOWS<|>NORTH KINGDOM<|>Stonebows bridge built during the power of the North Kingdom<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THAIN<|>KING<|>Thain held the authority of the king<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
