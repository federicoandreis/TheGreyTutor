Further  information  will  also  be  found in  the  selection  from  the  Red  Book  of  Westmarch  that  has already  been  published,  under  the  title  of  The  Hobbit.  That story  was  derived  from  the  earlier  chapters  of  the  Red  Book, composed  by  Bilbo  himself,  the  first  Hobbit  to  become famous  in  the  world  at  large,  and  called  by  him  There  and Back  Again ,  since  they  told  of  his  journey  into  the  East  and his  return:  an  adventure  which  later  involved  all  the  Hobbits in  the  great  events  of  that  Age  that  are  here  related.\nMany,  however,  may  wish  to  know  more  about  this  re¬ markable  people  from  the  outset,  while  some  may  not  possess the  earlier  book.  For  such  readers  a  few  notes  on  the  more important  points  are  here  collected  from  Hobbit-lore,  and the  first  adventure  is  briefly  recalled.\nHobbits  are  an  unobtrusive  but  very  ancient  people,  more numerous  formerly  than  they  are  today;  for  they  love  peace and  quiet  and  good  tilled  earth:  a  well-ordered  and  well- farmed  countryside  was  their  favourite  haunt.  They  do  not and  did  not  understand  or  like  machines  more  complicated than  a  forge-bellows,  a  water-mill,  or  a  hand-loom,  though they  were  skilful  with  tools.  Even  in  ancient  days  they were,  as  a  rule,  shy  of  ‘the  Big  Folk’,  as  they  call  us,  and now  they  avoid  us  with  dismay  and  are  becoming  hard  to find.  They  are  quick  of  hearing  and  sharp-eyed,  and  though they  are  inclined  to  be  fat  and  do  not  hurry  unnecessarily,  they are  nonetheless  nimble  and  deft  in  their  movements.  They\n2\nPROLOGUE\npossessed  from  the  first  the  art  of  disappearing  swiftly  and silently,  when  large  folk  whom  they  do  not  wish  to  meet  come blundering  by;  and  this  art  they  have  developed  until  to  Men it  may  seem  magical.  But  Hobbits  have  never,  in  fact,  studied magic  of  any  kind,  and  their  elusiveness  is  due  solely  to a  professional  skill  that  heredity  and  practice,  and  a  close friendship  with  the  earth,  have  rendered  inimitable  by  bigger and  clumsier  races.\nFor  they  are  a  little  people,  smaller  than  Dwarves:  less  stout and  stocky,  that  is,  even  when  they  are  not  actually  much shorter.  Their  height  is  variable,  ranging  between  two  and four  feet  of  our  measure.  They  seldom  now  reach  three  feet; but  they  have  dwindled,  they  say,  and  in  ancient  days  they were  taller.  According  to  the  Red  Book,  Bandobras  Took (Bullroarer),  son  of  Isumbras  the  Third,  was  four  foot  five and  able  to  ride  a  horse.  He  was  surpassed  in  all  Hobbit records  only  by  two  famous  characters  of  old;  but  that  curious matter  is  dealt  with  in  this  book.\nAs  for  the  Hobbits  of  the  Shire,  with  whom  these  tales  are concerned,  in  the  days  of  their  peace  and  prosperity  they were  a  merry  folk.  They  dressed  in  bright  colours,  being notably  fond  of  yellow  and  green;  but  they  seldom  wore shoes,  since  their  feet  had  tough  leathery  soles  and  were  clad in  a  thick  curling  hair,  much  like  the  hair  of  their  heads,  which was  commonly  brown.  Thus,  the  only  craft  little  practised among  them  was  shoe-making;  but  they  had  long  and  skilful fingers  and  could  make  many  other\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOBBITS<|>PERSON<|>Hobbits are an ancient and peaceful people who love peace, quiet, and well-farmed countryside.
