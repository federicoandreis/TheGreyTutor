Their  own accounts  speak  of  the  multiplying  of  Men  in  the  land,  and  of\n4\nPROLOGUE\na  shadow  that  fell  on  the  forest,  so  that  it  became  darkened and  its  new  name  was  Mirkwood.\nBefore  the  crossing  of  the  mountains  the  Hobbits  had already  become  divided  into  three  somewhat  different  breeds: Harfoots,  Stoors,  and  Fallohides.  The  Harfoots  were  browner of  skin,  smaller,  and  shorter,  and  they  were  beardless  and bootless;  their  hands  and  feet  were  neat  and  nimble;  and  they preferred  highlands  and  hillsides.  The  Stoors  were  broader, heavier  in  build;  their  feet  and  hands  were  larger;  and  they preferred  flat  lands  and  riversides.  The  Fallohides  were  fairer of  skin  and  also  of  hair,  and  they  were  taller  and  slimmer than  the  others;  they  were  lovers  of  trees  and  of  woodlands.\nThe  Harfoots  had  much  to  do  with  Dwarves  in  ancient times,  and  long  lived  in  the  foothills  of  the  mountains.  They moved  westward  early,  and  roamed  over  Eriador  as  far  as Weathertop  while  the  others  were  still  in  Wilderland.  They were  the  most  normal  and  representative  variety  of  Hobbit, and  far  the  most  numerous.  They  were  the  most  inclined  to settle  in  one  place,  and  longest  preserved  their  ancestral  habit of  living  in  tunnels  and  holes.\nThe  Stoors  lingered  long  by  the  banks  of  the  Great  River Anduin,  and  were  less  shy  of  Men.  They  came  west  after  the Harfoots  and  followed  the  course  of  the  Loudwater  south¬ wards;  and  there  many  of  them  long  dwelt  between  Tharbad and  the  borders  of  Dunland  before  they  moved  north  again.\nThe  Fallohides,  the  least  numerous,  were  a  northerly branch.  They  were  more  friendly  with  Elves  than  the  other Hobbits  were,  and  had  more  skill  in  language  and  song  than in  handicrafts;  and  of  old  they  preferred  hunting  to  tilling. They  crossed  the  mountains  north  of  Rivendell  and  came down  the  River  Hoarwell.  In  Eriador  they  soon  mingled  with the  other  kinds  that  had  preceded  them,  but  being  somewhat bolder  and  more  adventurous,  they  were  often  found  as leaders  or  chieftains  among  clans  of  Harfoots  or  Stoors.  Even in  Bilbo’s  time  the  strong  Fallohidish  strain  could  still  be noted  among  the  greater  families,  such  as  the  Tooks  and  the Masters  of  Buckland.\nPROLOGUE\n5\nIn  the  westlands  of  Eriador,  between  the  Misty  Mountains and  the  Mountains  of  Lune,  the  Hobbits  found  both  Men  and Elves.  Indeed,  a  remnant  still  dwelt  there  of  the  Dunedain,  the kings  of  Men  that  came  over  the  Sea  out  of  Westernesse;  but they  were  dwindling  fast  and  the  lands  of  their  North  King¬ dom  were  falling  far  and  wide  into  waste.  There  was  room and  to  spare  for  incomers,  and  ere  long  the  Hobbits  began to  settle  in  ordered  communities.  Most  of  their  earlier  settle¬ ments  had  long  disappeared  and  been  forgotten  in  Bilbo’s time;  but  one  of  the  first  to  become  important  still  endured, though  reduced  in  size;  this  was  at  Bree  and  in  the  Chetwood that  lay  round  about,  some  forty  miles  east  of  the  Shire.\nIt  was  in  these  early  days,  doubtless,  that  the  Hobbits learned  their  letters  and  began  to  write  after  the  manner  of the  Dunedain,  who  had  in  their  turn\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_dc088daf94382fb9921d827992a7977e6e84345c6627504e4b37f7ddb414c4b6_v2"}
