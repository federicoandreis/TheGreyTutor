But\ni6\nPROLOGUE\nafter  ages  alone  in  the  dark  Gollum’s  heart  was  black,  and treachery  was  in  it.  He  slipped  away,  and  returned  to  his island,  of  which  Bilbo  knew  nothing,  not  far  off  in  the  dark water.  There,  he  thought,  lay  his  ring.  He  was  hungry  now, and  angry,  and  once  his  ‘Precious’  was  with  him  he  would not  fear  any  weapon  at  all.\nBut  the  ring  was  not  on  the  island;  he  had  lost  it,  it  was gone.  His  screech  sent  a  shiver  down  Bilbo’s  back,  though  he did  not  yet  understand  what  had  happened.  But  Gollum  had at  last  leaped  to  a  guess,  too  late.  What  has  it  got  in  its pocketses?  he  cried.  The  light  in  his  eyes  was  like  a  green flame  as  he  sped  back  to  murder  the  hobbit  and  recover  his ‘Precious’.  Just  in  time  Bilbo  saw  his  peril,  and  he  fled  blindly up  the  passage  away  from  the  water;  and  once  more  he  was saved  by  his  luck.  For  as  he  ran  he  put  his  hand  in  his  pocket, and  the  ring  slipped  quietly  on  to  his  finger.  So  it  was  that Gollum  passed  him  without  seeing  him,  and  went  to  guard the  way  out,  lest  the  ‘thief’  should  escape.  Warily  Bilbo  fol¬ lowed  him,  as  he  went  along,  cursing,  and  talking  to  himself about  his  ‘Precious’;  from  which  talk  at  last  even  Bilbo guessed  the  truth,  and  hope  came  to  him  in  the  darkness:  he himself  had  found  the  marvellous  ring  and  a  chance  of  escape from  the  ores  and  from  Gollum.\nAt  length  they  came  to  a  halt  before  an  unseen  opening that  led  to  the  lower  gates  of  the  mines,  on  the  eastward  side of  the  mountains.  There  Gollum  crouched  at  bay,  smelling and  listening;  and  Bilbo  was  tempted  to  slay  him  with  his sword.  But  pity  stayed  him,  and  though  he  kept  the  ring,  in which  his  only  hope  lay,  he  would  not  use  it  to  help  him  kill the  wretched  creature  at  a  disadvantage.  In  the  end,  gathering his  courage,  he  leaped  over  Gollum  in  the  dark,  and  fled away  down  the  passage,  pursued  by  his  enemy’s  cries  of  hate and  despair:  Thief,  thief!  Baggins!  We  hates  it  for  ever!\nNow  it  is  a  curious  fact  that  this  is  not  the  story  as  Bilbo first  told  it  to  his  companions.  To  them  his  account  was  that Gollum  had  promised  to  give  him  a  present ,  if  he  won  the\nPROLOGUE\n17\ngame;  but  when  Gollum  went  to  fetch  it  from  his  island  he found  the  treasure  was  gone:  a  magic  ring,  which  had  been given  to  him  long  ago  on  his  birthday.  Bilbo  guessed  that  this was  the  very  ring  that  he  had  found,  and  as  he  had  won  the game,  it  was  already  his  by  right.  But  being  in  a  tight  place, he  said  nothing  about  it,  and  made  Gollum  show  him  the way  out,  as  a  reward  instead  of  a  present.  This  account  Bilbo set  down  in  his  memoirs,  and  he  seems  never  to  have  altered it  himself,  not  even  after  the  Council  of  Elrond.  Evidently  it still  appeared  in  the  original  Red  Book\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b024c2f232de73fefaf3c23c175bf838f44a2eb24e0ae752d595038f3b5183d1_v2"}
