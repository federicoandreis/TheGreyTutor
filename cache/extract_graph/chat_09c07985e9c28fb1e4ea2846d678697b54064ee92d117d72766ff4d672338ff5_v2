The  land  was  rich  and  kindly,  and though  it  had  long  been  deserted  when  they  entered  it,  it  had before  been  well  tilled,  and  there  the  king  had  once  had  many farms,  cornlands,  vineyards,  and  woods.\nForty  leagues  it  stretched  from  the  Far  Downs  to  the Brandywine  Bridge,  and  fifty  from  the  northern  moors  to the  marshes  in  the  south.  The  Hobbits  named  it  the  Shire, as  the  region  of  the  authority  of  their  Thain,  and  a  district of  well-ordered  business;  and  there  in  that  pleasant  corner  of the  world  they  plied  their  well-ordered  business  of  living,  and\n*  Thus,  the  years  of  the  Third  Age  in  the  reckoning  of  the  Elves  and the  Dunedain  may  be  found  by  adding  1600  to  the  dates  of  Shire¬ reckoning.\nPROLOGUE\n7\nthey  heeded  less  and  less  the  world  outside  where  dark  things moved,  until  they  came  to  think  that  peace  and  plenty  were the  rule  in  Middle-earth  and  the  right  of  all  sensible  folk. They  forgot  or  ignored  what  little  they  had  ever  known  of the  Guardians,  and  of  the  labours  of  those  that  made  possible the  long  peace  of  the  Shire.  They  were,  in  fact,  sheltered,  but they  had  ceased  to  remember  it.\nAt  no  time  had  Hobbits  of  any  kind  been  warlike,  and  they had  never  fought  among  themselves.  In  olden  days  they  had, of  course,  been  often  obliged  to  fight  to  maintain  themselves in  a  hard  world;  but  in  Bilbo’s  time  that  was  very  ancient history.  The  last  battle,  before  this  story  opens,  and  indeed the  only  one  that  had  ever  been  fought  within  the  borders of  the  Shire,  was  beyond  living  memory:  the  Battle  of Greenfields,  S.R.  1147,  in  which  Bandobras  Took  routed  an invasion  of  Ores.  Even  the  weathers  had  grown  milder,  and the  wolves  that  had  once  come  ravening  out  of  the  North  in bitter  white  winters  were  now  only  a  grandfather’s  tale.  So, though  there  was  still  some  store  of  weapons  in  the  Shire, these  were  used  mostly  as  trophies,  hanging  above  hearths  or on  walls,  or  gathered  into  the  museum  at  Michel  Delving. The  Mathom-house  it  was  called;  for  anything  that  Hobbits had  no  immediate  use  for,  but  were  unwilling  to  throw  away, they  called  a  mathom.  Their  dwellings  were  apt  to  become rather  crowded  with  mathoms,  and  many  of  the  presents  that passed  from  hand  to  hand  were  of  that  sort.\nNonetheless,  ease  and  peace  had  left  this  people  still  curi¬ ously  tough.  They  were,  if  it  came  to  it,  difficult  to  daunt  or to  kill;  and  they  were,  perhaps,  so  unwearyingly  fond  of  good things  not  least  because  they  could,  when  put  to  it,  do  without them,  and  could  survive  rough  handling  by  grief,  foe,  or weather  in  a  way  that  astonished  those  who  did  not  know them  well  and  looked  no  further  than  their  bellies  and  their well-fed  faces.  Though  slow  to  quarrel,  and  for  sport  killing nothing  that  lived,  they  were  doughty  at  bay,  and  at  need could  still  handle  arms.  They  shot  well  with  the  bow,  for  they were  keen-eyed  and  sure  at  the  mark.  Not  only  with  bows  and\nPROLOGUE\narrows.
