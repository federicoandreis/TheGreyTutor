This  account  Bilbo set  down  in  his  memoirs,  and  he  seems  never  to  have  altered it  himself,  not  even  after  the  Council  of  Elrond.  Evidently  it still  appeared  in  the  original  Red  Book,  as  it  did  in  several  of the  copies  and  abstracts.  But  many  copies  contain  the  true account  (as  an  alternative),  derived  no  doubt  from  notes  by Frodo  or  Samwise,  both  of  whom  learned  the  truth,  though they  seem  to  have  been  unwilling  to  delete  anything  actually written  by  the  old  hobbit  himself.\nGandalf,  however,  disbelieved  Bilbo’s  first  story,  as  soon as  he  heard  it,  and  he  continued  to  be  very  curious  about  the ring.  Eventually  he  got  the  true  tale  out  of  Bilbo  after  much questioning,  which  for  a  while  strained  their  friendship;  but the  wizard  seemed  to  think  the  truth  important.  Though  he did  not  say  so  to  Bilbo,  he  also  thought  it  important,  and disturbing,  to  find  that  the  good  hobbit  had  not  told  the truth  from  the  first:  quite  contrary  to  his  habit.  The  idea  of  a ‘present’  was  not  mere  hobbitlike  invention,  all  the  same.  It was  suggested  to  Bilbo,  as  he  confessed,  by  Gollum’s  talk that  he  overheard;  for  Gollum  did,  in  fact,  call  the  ring  his ‘birthday-present’,  many  times.  That  also  Gandalf  thought strange  and  suspicious;  but  he  did  not  discover  the  truth in  this  point  for  many  more  years,  as  will  be  seen  in  this book.\nOf  Bilbo’s  later  adventures  little  more  need  be  said  here. With  the  help  of  the  ring  he  escaped  from  the  ore-guards  at the  gate  and  rejoined  his  companions.  He  used  the  ring  many times  on  his  quest,  chiefly  for  the  help  of  his  friends;  but  he kept  it  secret  from  them  as  long  as  he  could.  After  his  return to  his  home  he  never  spoke  of  it  again  to  anyone,  save  Gandalf\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS\nand  Frodo;  and  no  one  else  in  the  Shire  knew  of  its  existence, or  so  he  believed.  Only  to  Frodo  did  he  show  the  account  of his  Journey  that  he  was  writing.\nHis  sword,  Sting,  Bilbo  hung  over  his  fireplace,  and  his coat  of  marvellous  mail,  the  gift  of  the  Dwarves  from  the Dragon-hoard,  he  lent  to  a  museum,  to  the  Michel  Delving Mathom-house  in  fact.  But  he  kept  in  a  drawer  at  Bag  End the  old  cloak  and  hood  that  he  had  worn  on  his  travels; and  the  ring,  secured  by  a  fine  chain,  remained  in  his pocket.\nHe  returned  to  his  home  at  Bag  End  on  June  the  22nd  in his  fifty-second  year  (S.R.  1342),  and  nothing  very  notable occurred  in  the  Shire  until  Mr.  Baggins  began  the  prep¬ arations  for  the  celebration  of  his  hundred-and-eleventh birthday  (S.R.  1401).  At  this  point  this  History  begins.\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS\nAt  the  end  of  the  Third  Age  the  part  played  by  the  Hobbits in  the  great  events  that  led  to  the  inclusion  of  the  Shire  in  the Reunited  Kingdom  awakened  among  them  a  more  wide¬ spread  interest  in  their  own  history;  and  many  of  their  tra¬ ditions,  up  to  that  time  still  mainly  oral,  were  collected  and written  down.
