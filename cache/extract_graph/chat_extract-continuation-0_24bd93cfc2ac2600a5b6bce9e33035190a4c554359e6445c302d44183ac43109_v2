Thus,  the  only  craft  little  practised among  them  was  shoe-making;  but  they  had  long  and  skilful fingers  and  could  make  many  other  useful  and  comely  things. Their  faces  were  as  a  rule  good-natured  rather  than  beau¬ tiful,  broad,  bright-eyed,  red-cheeked,  with  mouths  apt  to laughter,  and  to  eating  and  drinking.  And  laugh  they  did,  and eat,  and  drink,  often  and  heartily,  being  fond  of  simple  jests at  all  times,  and  of  six  meals  a  day  (when  they  could  get them) .  They  were  hospitable  and  delighted  in  parties,  and  in presents,  which  they  gave  away  freely  and  eagerly  accepted.\nIt  is  plain  indeed  that  in  spite  of  later  estrangement  Hobbits are  relatives  of  ours:  far  nearer  to  us  than  Elves,  or  even  than Dwarves.  Of  old  they  spoke  the  languages  of  Men,  after  their\nPROLOGUE\n3\nown  fashion,  and  liked  and  disliked  much  the  same  things  as Men  did.  But  what  exactly  our  relationship  is  can  no  longer be  discovered.  The  beginning  of  Hobbits  lies  far  back  in  the Elder  Days  that  are  now  lost  and  forgotten.  Only  the  Elves still  preserve  any  records  of  that  vanished  time,  and  their traditions  are  concerned  almost  entirely  with  their  own  his¬ tory,  in  which  Men  appear  seldom  and  Hobbits  are  not  men¬ tioned  at  all.  Yet  it  is  clear  that  Hobbits  had,  in  fact,  lived quietly  in  Middle-earth  for  many  long  years  before  other  folk became  even  aware  of  them.  And  the  world  being  after  all full  of  strange  creatures  beyond  count,  these  little  people seemed  of  very  little  importance.  But  in  the  days  of  Bilbo, and  of  Frodo  his  heir,  they  suddenly  became,  by  no  wish  of their  own,  both  important  and  renowned,  and  troubled  the counsels  of  the  Wise  and  the  Great.\nThose  days,  the  Third  Age  of  Middle-earth,  are  now  long past,  and  the  shape  of  all  lands  has  been  changed;  but  the regions  in  which  Hobbits  then  lived  were  doubtless  the  same as  those  in  which  they  still  linger:  the  North-West  of  the  Old World,  east  of  the  Sea.  Of  their  original  home  the  Hobbits in  Bilbo’s  time  preserved  no  knowledge.  A  love  of  learning (other  than  genealogical  lore)  was  far  from  general  among them,  but  there  remained  still  a  few  in  the  older  families  who studied  their  own  books,  and  even  gathered  reports  of  old times  and  distant  lands  from  Elves,  Dwarves,  and  Men.  Their own  records  began  only  after  the  settlement  of  the  Shire,  and their  most  ancient  legends  hardly  looked  further  back  than their  Wandering  Days.  It  is  clear,  nonetheless,  from  these legends,  and  from  the  evidence  of  their  peculiar  words  and customs,  that  like  many  other  folk  Hobbits  had  in  the  distant past  moved  westward.  Their  earliest  tales  seem  to  glimpse  a time  when  they  dwelt  in  the  upper  vales  of  Anduin,  between the  eaves  of  Greenwood  the  Great  and  the  Misty  Mountains. Why  they  later  undertook  the  hard  and  perilous  crossing  of the  mountains  into  Eriador  is  no  longer  certain.  Their  own accounts  speak  of  the  multiplying  of  Men  in  the  land,  and  of\n4\nPROLOGUE\na  shadow  that  fell  on  the  forest,  so  that  it  became  darkened and  its  new  name  was  Mirkwood.\nBefore\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOBBITS<|>PERSON<|>Hobbits are a small, good-natured people with a love of laughter, eating, and drinking, known for their hospitality and love of parties and presents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELVES<|>PERSON<|>Elves are distant relatives of Hobbits, with whom they share some similarities in language and preferences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DWARVES<|>PERSON<|>Dwarves are distant relatives of Hobbits, with whom they share some similarities in language and preferences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILBO<|>PERSON<|>Bilbo is an important and renowned Hobbit who troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRODO<|>PERSON<|>Frodo is the heir of Bilbo, also an important and renowned Hobbit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDDLE-EARTH<|>GEO<|>Middle-earth is the land where Hobbits lived during the Third Age, now long past)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIRE<|>GEO<|>The Shire is the settlement where Hobbits lived and where their records began)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDUIN<|>GEO<|>Anduin is a river where Hobbits are said to have dwelt in the upper vales)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENWOOD THE GREAT<|>GEO<|>Greenwood the Great is a forest near where Hobbits are said to have dwelt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISTY MOUNTAINS<|>GEO<|>The Misty Mountains are mountains near where Hobbits are said to have dwelt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERIADOR<|>GEO<|>Eriador is a region where Hobbits crossed the mountains into)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRKWOOD<|>GEO<|>Mirkwood is a darkened forest where Hobbits crossed the mountains into)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>ELVES<|>Hobbits are distant relatives of Elves, sharing some similarities in language and preferences<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>DWARVES<|>Hobbits are distant relatives of Dwarves, sharing some similarities in language and preferences<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILBO<|>HOBBITS<|>Bilbo is an important and renowned Hobbit who troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRODO<|>HOBBITS<|>Frodo is the heir of Bilbo, also an important and renowned Hobbit<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>MIDDLE-EARTH<|>Hobbits lived in Middle-earth during the Third Age<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>SHIRE<|>Hobbits lived in the Shire where their records began<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>ANDUIN<|>Hobbits are said to have dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>GREENWOOD THE GREAT<|>Hobbits are said to have dwelt near Greenwood the Great<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>MISTY MOUNTAINS<|>Hobbits are said to have dwelt near the Misty Mountains<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>ERIADOR<|>Hobbits crossed the mountains into Eriador<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOBBITS<|>MIRKWOOD<|>Hobbits crossed the mountains into Mirkwood<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
