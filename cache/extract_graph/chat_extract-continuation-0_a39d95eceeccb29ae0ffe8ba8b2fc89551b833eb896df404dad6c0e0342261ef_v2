The  greater  families  were  also  concerned  with events  in  the  Kingdom  at  large,  and  many  of  their  members studied  its  ancient  histories  and  legends.  By  the  end  of  the first  century  of  the  Fourth  Age  there  were  already  to  be  found in  the  Shire  several  libraries  that  contained  many  historical books  and  records.\nThe  largest  of  these  collections  were  probably  at  Under¬ towers,  at  Great  Smials,  and  at  Brandy  Hall.  This  account  of the  end  of  the  Third  Age  is  drawn  mainly  from  the  Red  Book of  Westmarch.  That  most  important  source  for  the  history of  the  War  of  the  Ring  was  so  called  because  it  was  long preserved  at  Undertowers,  the  home  of  the  Fairbairns,\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS\n19\nWardens  of  the  Westmarch.*  It  was  in  origin  Bilbo’s  private diary,  which  he  took  with  him  to  Rivendell.  Frodo  brought  it back  to  the  Shire,  together  with  many  loose  leaves  of  notes, and  during  S.R.  1420-1  he  nearly  filled  its  pages  with  his account  of  the  War.  But  annexed  to  it  and  preserved  with  it, probably  in  a  single  red  case,  were  the  three  large  volumes, bound  in  red  leather,  that  Bilbo  gave  to  him  as  a  parting  gift. To  these  four  volumes  there  was  added  in  Westmarch  a fifth  containing  commentaries,  genealogies,  and  various  other matter  concerning  the  hobbit  members  of  the  Fellowship.\nThe  original  Red  Book  has  not  been  preserved,  but  many copies  were  made,  especially  of  the  first  volume,  for  the  use of  the  descendants  of  the  children  of  Master  Samwise.  The most  important  copy,  however,  has  a  different  history.  It  was kept  at  Great  Smials,  but  it  was  written  in  Gondor,  probably at  the  request  of  the  great-grandson  of  Peregrin,  and  com¬ pleted  in  S.R.  1592  (F.A.  172).  Its  southern  scribe  appended this  note:  Findegil,  King’s  Writer,  finished  this  work  in  IV 172.  It  is  an  exact  copy  in  all  details  of  the  Thain’s  Book  in Minas  Tirith.  That  book  was  a  copy,  made  at  the  request  of King  Elessar,  of  the  Red  Book  of  the  Periannath,  and  was brought  to  him  by  the  Thain  Peregrin  when  he  retired  to Gondor  in  IV  64.\nThe  Thain’s  Book  was  thus  the  first  copy  made  of  the  Red Book  and  contained  much  that  was  later  omitted  or  lost.  In Minas  Tirith  it  received  much  annotation,  and  many  correc¬ tions,  especially  of  names,  words,  and  quotations  in  the  Elvish languages;  and  there  was  added  to  it  an  abbreviated  version of  those  parts  of  The  Tale  of  Aragorn  and  Arwen  which  lie outside  the  account  of  the  War.  The  full  tale  is  stated  to  have been  written  by  Barahir,  grandson  of  the  Steward  Faramir, some  time  after  the  passing  of  the  King.  But  the  chief  impor¬ tance  of  Findegil’s  copy  is  that  it  alone  contains  the  whole  of Bilbo’s  ‘Translations  from  the  Elvish’.  These  three  volumes\n*  See  Appendix  B:  annals  1451,  1462,  1482;  and  note  at  end  of Appendix  C.\n20\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS\nwere\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHIRE<|>GEO<|>The Shire is a region in the Reunited Kingdom with a rich history and tradition of collecting and preserving historical records)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNDERTOWERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Undertowers is a location in the Shire known for its historical book collection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT SMIALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Great Smials is a location in the Shire known for its historical book collection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDY HALL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brandy Hall is a location in the Shire known for its historical book collection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH<|>EVENT<|>The Red Book of Westmarch is a historical source for the War of the Ring, preserved at Undertowers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILBO<|>PERSON<|>Bilbo is the original author of the Red Book of Westmarch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRODO<|>PERSON<|>Frodo brought the Red Book of Westmarch back to the Shire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMWISE<|>PERSON<|>Descendants of Samwise used copies of the Red Book of Westmarch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINDEGIL<|>PERSON<|>Findegil, King's Writer, completed a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch in Gondor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEREGRIN<|>PERSON<|>Peregrin's great-grandson requested a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch in Gondor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELESSAR<|>PERSON<|>King Elessar requested a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILBO<|>RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH<|>Bilbo is the original author of the Red Book of Westmarch<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRODO<|>RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH<|>Frodo brought the Red Book of Westmarch back to the Shire<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINDEGIL<|>RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH<|>Findegil completed a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch in Gondor<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEREGRIN<|>RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH<|>Peregrin's great-grandson requested a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch in Gondor<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELESSAR<|>RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH<|>King Elessar requested a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINDEGIL<|>PEREGRIN<|>Findegil completed a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch at the request of Peregrin's great-grandson<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
