In the histories of Middle-earth, the line of kings in Gondor is significant, particularly with the return of Aragorn, who took up the mantle of King Elessar.

The themes of loyalty and courage are indeed central to their relationship, as seen in the valor displayed during the Battle of the Hornburg.
