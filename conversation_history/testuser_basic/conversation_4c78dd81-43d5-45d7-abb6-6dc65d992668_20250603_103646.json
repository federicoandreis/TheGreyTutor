It was in these lands that the courageous D\u00fanedain roamed, guarding the realm against the shadows of the East. Canst thou name the noble lineage that claims the highlands as their ancestral home, often associated with the great city of Minas Tirith?",

          "explanation": "The student's answer, 'I can't recall,' does not address the question posed regarding the noble lineage associated with the highlands and the city of Minas Tirith. While honesty in one's limitations is commendable, it lacks the necessary engagement with the lore of Middle-earth.",

            "The answer fails to identify the D\u00fanedain or the heirs of Isildur, which is central to the question.",
