          "explanation": "The answer provided by the student is incorrect. The noble guest known for his unyielding spirit and kindness who was ever at the side of the One Ring's bearer is Frodo Baggins himself. Frodo, a hobbit of the Shire, bore the One Ring on its perilous journey to Mount Doom. While Legolas is indeed a noble character and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, he did not bear the Ring nor was he the primary guide for Frodo. Instead, it was Gandalf, Aragorn, and Samwise Gamgee who played pivotal roles in guiding Frodo through his trials. Understanding the roles of these characters is essential to grasping the depth of Tolkien's narrative.",

            "The student correctly identifies a character from the Fellowship of the Ring.",

Valandil was the first king of Arnor after the death of his father Isildur, who was a significant figure in the history of Middle-earth, particularly in the struggle against Sauron.
