          "explanation": "Ah, dear student, while 'Sovereign' is a term that can indeed denote a ruler, the title most commonly bestowed upon the rulers of Gondor is 'King.' This title carries great weight in the histories of Middle-earth, particularly as it pertains to the line of Isildur and the legacy of the D\u00fanedain. Remember, in Gondor, the rightful ruler is often referred to as 'King,' especially during the time of Aragorn, who reclaimed this title at the end of the Third Age.",
          "strengths": [
            "The term 'Sovereign' is relevant and shows an understanding of rulership.",
            "You have engaged with the concept of leadership in Gondor."
          ],
          "weaknesses": [
            "The answer does not align with the specific title used in Tolkien's works.",
            "It lacks the historical context that 'King' provides in relation to Gondor."
          ],
          "suggestions": [
            "Review the titles and roles of key figures in Gondor's history, particularly during the reign of Aragorn.",
            "Consider the significance of titles in Tolkien's lore, as they often carry deeper meanings and connections to lineage."
